# Python 2018

My first steps in python, starting with the workshop at AIS on *November 16, 2018*.

Hello World! and calculating prime numbers work well.

## December 2019

Now python runs on esp8266 and esp32 as well. With REPL you see the result immideately.

It is also possible to compare the code in python and Arduino C accross devices.
