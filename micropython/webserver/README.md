# Webserver in micropython on esp32 and eso8266

A simple webserver is well described by [randomnerdtutorials](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/) Rui and Sara Santos from Portugal. Please read their tutorial!

You only need two files on your micropython machine: [boot.py](boot.py) and [main.py](main.py). Then connect to the IP address of your machine with your phone and browser and within 10 minutes you have your first micropython webserver running!
